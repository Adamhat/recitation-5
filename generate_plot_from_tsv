#
# This is a simple script that will plot a TSV file as a line graph using
# gnuplot.  You can run it like so.
#
#   ./generate_plot_from_tsv
#
# Importantly, make sure you set the values of the variables INFILE and OUTFILE
# below as follows:
#   INFILE - should contain the name of the TSV file containing data to be
#     plotted, e.g. "results.tsv"
#   OUTFILE - should contain the name of a JPEG file to which the generated
#     plot image will be saved, e.g. "plot.jpg"
#

INFILE="results.tsv"
OUTFILE="plot.jpg"

set terminal jpeg
set style data lines
